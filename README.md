# ERC20 Token and Vault Contracts

## Overview

This repository contains the code for ERC20 token and Vault contracts, which are designed to facilitate the creation and management of ERC20 tokens along with a secure vault for storing these tokens.

## Contracts

### ERC20 Token Contract

The ERC20 token contract implements the standard ERC20 interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides functions to transfer tokens between addresses, approve spending limits for addresses, and transfer tokens on behalf of another address.

#### Features:
- Standard ERC20 interface implementation.
- Functions for transferring tokens, checking balances, and approving spending limits.
- Built-in functionality for handling token approvals and transfers.

#### Usage:
1. Deploy the ERC20 token contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Customize the token name, symbol, and initial supply as desired.
3. Interact with the contract using Ethereum wallet software or smart contract calls to transfer tokens, check balances, and approve spending limits.

### Vault Contract

The Vault contract provides a secure mechanism for storing ERC20 tokens. It allows users to deposit tokens into the vault and withdraw them as needed, with added features for security and access control.

#### Features:
- Secure storage of ERC20 tokens.
- Functions for depositing and withdrawing tokens.
- Access control mechanisms to restrict withdrawals to authorized addresses.

#### Usage:
1. Deploy the Vault contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Connect the Vault contract with the desired ERC20 token contract.
3. Configure access control settings to define who can deposit and withdraw tokens.
4. Deposit tokens into the vault using the appropriate function.
5. Withdraw tokens from the vault as needed, subject to access control restrictions.

## Installation

To deploy the contracts locally or on a testnet/mainnet, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/erc20-vault-contracts.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Compile contracts: `truffle compile`
4. Deploy contracts: `truffle migrate`
